                <p><label>I'm coming from far away! How do I get there?</label>
                    Look up Rochester Institute of Technology on any map! If you're flying, the Greater Rochester
                    International Airport is about twenty minutes away.

                </p>
                <p><label>Where can I stay?</label>
                    If you're looking for a hotel, we recommend the RIT Inn or the Rochester Radisson, both
                    conveniently five minutes away from our campus. If you're looking to save money, some of RIT's
                    design students are willing to offer up their couches. If you need a couch to crash on, send us an
                    email. We'll connect you with one of our students!
                </p>

                <p><label>What time should I arrive?</label>
                Our registration table opens at 9am on Friday, so feel free to get here anytime! Our opening reception will be held at 1pm, so you can grab lunch or hang with us if you get here early. If you're couch-surfing with someone, be sure to get their contact information so you can meet up.
                Also, RIT's Vignelli Center , home to the archive of designers Massimo and Leila Vignelli, will be open for tours starting at noon on Friday, so feel free to sign up for a tour once you've checked in.
                </p>

                <p><label>Where should I go first?</label>
                    Here's an interactive map of RIT! Guest parking will be available in lots G and H. Once you've parked, head towards the Booth building (labeled 'BOO' on this map) - signs will point you inside and to our registration table.
                </p>


                <p><label>What about the rest of the weekend?</label>
                    After you check in, our very first event will be a formal opening in RIT's University Gallery, on Friday at 1pm. Students at the registration table will point you in the right direction. At the opening, we'll explain everything you'll need to know.
                    Once you check in, you'll be given a brochure that will show each day's events. You can preview what's to come by looking at our schedule. It's being updated every day as we get closer to the conference, so keep checking back!

                </p>

                <p><label>Should I bring anything?</label>
                    If you have a portfolio, please bring it along for our Portfolio Review on Friday night! You'll get the chance to have a one-on-one critique with any of our speakers.
                    Also, because this is a networking opportunity, we highly recommend bringing business cards or anything else you'd want to give or show to other designers.

                </p>

                <p><label>How should I dress?</label>
                    Casual but presentable is recommended.
                </p>

                <p><label>Will I get stuff?</label>
                    Yep, you'll get stuff! We'll have some freebies for you in your swag bag, and more throughout the weekend. Stay tuned!
                </p>

                <p><label>Can I show off my design skills?</label>
                    Of course! Thought At Work is all about bringing together students from all over to learn, network and have fun. We will have an electronic slideshow on display, to showcase student work from anyone attending. This is a great chance for you to see what students from other schools are making, what their curricula focus on, and how they address design.
                    Send us an email with your work attached as a PDF or image file, your name, your major, and your school. It can be an entire portfolio, a single project, or whatever you want!

                </p>

                <p><label>Will food be provided?</label>
                    3 meals will be provided throughout the weekend (one on each day). Weâ€™ll tell you more when we have all our ducks in a row!
                </p>
