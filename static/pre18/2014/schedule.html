            <h3 style="padding-bottom:15px;">Brad Ascalon and Josh Owen will be having an informal conversation on the role of design as strategy, designer as strategist. We will contextualize Design as a driving force for creating business opportunities, for finding niches in the market or simply a client’s own product line. There are many pros and cons to the popularity of Design in recent years. Among the cons is the notion that a designer’s role is as stylist. This has been brought about in large part by endless blogs of eye candy, and on the part of designers and readers alike, the forgoing of context for visual consumption. Designing for those outlets may give us fifteen minutes of fame, but it doesn’t lay the groundwork for a sustainable career. Utilizing design as a strategic tool in one’s arsenal gives the designer both quantitative and qualitative value. It is this value that leads to longevity for the designer.  It is, well, invaluable.</h3>
