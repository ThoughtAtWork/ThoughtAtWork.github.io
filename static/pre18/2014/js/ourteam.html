                    <p>I have recently begun working on my thesis. I plan to research about and design transgenerational products for juveniles. I’m going to design products and concepts that can last throughout multiple stages of a child’s development.</p>

I come from an Engineering background in high school but an artistic one from home so Design seems to suit me pretty well!

I, along with rest of our team are really excited about what we've accomplished.</p>

                    <p>Hello! My name is Tom Kemper, I am a 5th year student studying New Media Design and Imaging at RIT. I am a native of Rochester, and I have always been very interested in the creative arts, so learning design at RIT was an easy career choice.</p>
                    <p>I focus on interface design, 3D motion graphics, and branding, and Thought at Work has been the perfect opportunity to apply my skills. As a member of the team, I focus on raising awareness for the event, as well as creating a marketing foundation for future years to come. I hope to do my part to propel the conference, as well as the RIT design school, to greater heights.</p>

                    <p>Hello! This is my fourth year at RIT and my first being part of the Thought at Work team. I am a strong believer in education with variety, and TAW is perfect for sharing design ideas and experiences.</p>
                    <p>Industrial design caught my attention because human/ technology interaction is something that has always fascinated me, and is a necessary aspect to our existence. I grew up with lots of experiences with the natural world, and environmentally conscious design is an important trend that our society is and should be embracing. Both for morality and for survival.</p>
