                    <p>Hey I'm Vedant, I'm one of the lead coordinators of the conference.  I'm from Culver City, California and I'm an Industrial Design major. I wanted to be a part of a discipline where one never stops learning, I like watching lots of shows and movies. In my free time I like to work of personal projects like making prop replicas from the movies like Iron Man.</p>

                    <p>Hi! I'm Hannah, and I'm a co-coordinator for what will be my third Thought at Work! I handle the conference's logistics as well as a little bit of everything else. Thought at Work has provided me with so many amazing opportunities to learn about design, teamwork, event planning, and thinking outside the box, and I'm excited to see us grow bigger every year. I'm an ID student from Harrisburg, PA, and in my free time I can be found writing, drawing comics, and drinking lots of coffee.</p>

                    <p>My name is Mick Bartholomew, I'm a third year Industrial Design major with a minor in Entrepreneurship. I'm from Amherst, Ohio, just outside of Cleveland. I joined the Thought At Work crew as a freshman to get involved with the student design community both at RIT and surrounding schools, as well as professionals. Attending the 2012 conference had such a positive impact on my education I felt I was missing out on something great if I didn't try to help. I have had the opportunity to reach out to professionals and students about Thought At Work, as well as help drive the direction of the conference. Be sure to say “Hi” if you see me around, or reach out to me if you need anything. You can find my information through my LinkedIn.

                    This year I am a part of putting together this awesome website you’re looking at right now for the upcoming conference. When i’m not swimming in all the projects I always seem to get myself into, I’m a big fan of traveling and catching up on my sleep.</p>

                    <p>I love everything about the work of design and cannot wait to be more involved as I grow as a designer. Advertising through design is a special interest of mine; grabbing the attention of the audience in a split second so that they want to learn more about what is being said.</p>
                    <p>I am a part of the design team for Thought At Work. I help with the branding that is associated with the conference throughout different applications. Within the graphics team we develop our concepts around what Thought At Work is all about.

                    <p>Hi, my name's Tim Torres. Some people call me Tim Torres. I'm from Hershey, Pennsylvania (as in the chocolate), and this is my first year on the Thought at Work team and I hope to contribute a lot in the coming years. I'm a New Media Design major, which I love because we learn a huge range of things.</p>
                    <p>Some of my interests and hobbies include photography, web design and development, 3D modeling and animation, motion video and special effects, drawing, painting, and making various electronics projects. I am also a sprinter on the RIT Track and Field team and participate in various intramurals like soccer, frisbee, volleyball, dodgeball, and broomball.</p>
                    <p>I like to read (as if I even had the time) and watch movies, but one of my greatest loves is biking. I'm a member of New Media Club, InterVarsity, PUB Club, and I live in Computer Science House. Doge forever.</p>

                    <p>I have been a member of the Thought at Work team since my sophomore year. I wanted to join our conference team so that I could strengthen my relationships within my field of study, as well as with other peers and professionals. We have been working hard to encourage attendees to the conference and to expand our outreach within the design world. One of the best parts of attending any conference is meeting peers with the same ambitions as yourself. We hope you enjoy the conference and continue to return!</p>

                    <p>Interior Design | 4th year</p>
                    <p>Hi, my name is Amy, I'm an Interior Design major with a minor in Business Administration and I'm from Honolulu, Hawaii. I got involved with Thought at Work this year because I want to help interior design become a part of the conference, which I'm really excited for! The opportunity to learn and experience so much in one weekend is an amazing concept, which is also why I decided to join the TAW team.</p>
                    <p>I love to travel, eat good food, and learn, so I went to study Interior Architecture in Copenhagen, Denmark last fall which was why I was unable to attend the previous conference. However, that experience helped me realize how important TAW is because of its role to expose us students to new and thought provoking ideas without even leaving campus.</p>

                    <p>Hey!  I'm Alex, but everyone just calls me Crandall.  I'm a 3rd Year New Media Designer from a small town just outside of Albany, NY.  This is my first time working with the Thought at Work Conference.  I am really looking forward to working with all aspects of the creative community here at RIT to put on the best conference possible.</p>

                    <p>New Media Design | 2nd year</p>
                    <p>Hi, I'm Kelly!  I'm a second year New Media Design student from right here in Rochester, NY.  After attending the Thought at Work conference last fall and talking with team members, it was clear to me that the creative energy and collaboration of Thought at Work was something unique that I wanted to be a part of.  I loved the idea of students working together to create something much bigger than themselves.  As a team member this year, I am looking forward to designing graphics, meeting new people, and helping out in any other way that I can.  My goal is to enhance my skills as a designer while also contributing to an enriching conference experience.</p>
