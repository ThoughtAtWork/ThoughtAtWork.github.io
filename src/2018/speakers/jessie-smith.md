job: Product Designer at Adobe
bio: Jessie Smith is a UX designer, lettering artist and illustrator working in New York City. After graduating with a degree in New Media Design from RIT in 2016, Jessie moved to Brooklyn and started working as a designer on Creative Cloud apps and web flows at Adobe. In the fall of 2016, Jessie started Tangible Design Shop with her husband, Doug, in an effort to keep creating outside of her UX work at Adobe. Her work is focused on branding, as well as her own personal lettering projects, which she sells on Etsy. Last year, Jessie started teaching lettering workshops in the New York City area. Outside of work, she leads a community group with her church, loves to walk around her neighborhood and occasionally escapes the hustle of New York City to go hiking on the weekends.\n
