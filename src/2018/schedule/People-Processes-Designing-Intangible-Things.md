  description: >-
    Design school is a great place to learn about how to design tangible things: logos, posters, digital products, app interfaces, videos, and service concepts. But what about designing the intangible? Grasping the intangible often requires embracing an attitude that enables you to navigate through the fog of messy systems and politics so that you can design clear and meaningful solutions. \n\nI will share my experience applying design to social problems and unpack how I have used the methods I learned in design school to create processes that drive collaboration, creative problem-solving, and organizational learning within large institutions. Weâ€™ll look at things like how design-informed approaches can help individuals experiencing homelessness access services, improve the quality of care within the child welfare system, and rethink how we support people in the criminal justice system.
