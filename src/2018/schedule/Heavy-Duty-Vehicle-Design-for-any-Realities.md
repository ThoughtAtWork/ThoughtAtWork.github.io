  description: >-
    Industrial design is art with a purpose and one or many customers. Creating an engaging, memorable design is a mad feat of juggling multiple customer needs, aesthetic considerations, and injecting newness. Sitting down with a blank piece of paper can be paralyzing without a good process. With more than 20 years of design experience, John A. Frye reveals some of the simple methods and tools he uses regularly to tackle new design projects with ease.
