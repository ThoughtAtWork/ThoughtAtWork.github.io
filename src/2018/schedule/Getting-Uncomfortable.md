  description: >-
    Good work comes from being uncomfortable, and discomfort can mean different things to different people. Recently, I learned that I create average work when I am comfortable and not being pushed or challenged. But once I create discomfort, I become challenged to do more than the average, and thatâ€™s when I create work that is truly creative. 
    
    This talk will cover what I do to continually be challenged, including work at Stink Studios that invoked discomfort, what it looks like to run an independent newsletter, and finding ways you can challenge yourself in your daily life.
