description: >-
  Knowing what problem to solve next is a complicated task. It is even more difficult when designing products or services for humans. It is imperative for designers to understand how to practice effective discovery methods in order to solve real problems for customers as well as simultaneously feeding delivery efforts.\n \nThe Lean UX Canvas is a tool that we use that helps us effectively frame our work, establish outcomes, know who we are designing for, and test our assumptions. This helps us create a collaborative, customer-centric environment that brings together product design, user experience, engineering, and product management, that focuses on building the right product and building the product right.
