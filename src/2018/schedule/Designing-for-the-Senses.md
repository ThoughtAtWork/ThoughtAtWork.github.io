  description: >-
    Human senses are how we experience the world. Whether it is products, services, graphics, or user interfaces, we are constantly surrounded by designs that stimuli our senses. To design around the senses is to give the power of a memorable experience. Not only do visuals revive our memory, but studies have shown that sounds, smells, and tastes do as well. How do we as designers design solutions to heighten peopleâ€™s memory and experience? But, can senses be used to confuse us? Can they be used against the user to benefit the business?\n\nIn a world where technology is consuming us how do we continue to design for the senses? Many people are worried that our generation (millennial, gen z, and future generations) are losing our ability to have face to face conversations, to sit still and focus for more than 2 minutes, and so many other concerns. It is up to us as designers to heighten the power of senses because we are the ones who are in charge of what our future looks, feels, smells, tastes, and sounds like. \n
