  description: >-
    Design as a discipline has been on an amazing journey, beginning with objects, growing to include graphics and print, and more recently moving into motion and interaction. However as the industry has matured and the tools have become more homogeneous, designers are growing restless, looking for what's next. Thankfully, there's a growing appetite for designers' skills in industries previously unable to benefit from their abilities. Tools like Cinder and Processing are paving the way for partnerships between designers and technologists that will fundamentally change not just the content of our screens but also physical environments like museums and retail.
