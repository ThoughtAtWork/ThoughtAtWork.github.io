description: >-
  Archives and libraries contain infinite resources for twenty-first century typographic inspiration. Obscure matrices, colonial papers, scrawling personal letters, and rare films from the RIT Cary Graphic Arts Collection have all recently stimulated creative endeavors by our most enthusiastic patrons—type designers, educators, and designers like you! Join me, “your typographic librarian,” as I describe some great projects where history, technology, and design intersect—perhaps encouraging you to get to know your campus rare book library scientist.
