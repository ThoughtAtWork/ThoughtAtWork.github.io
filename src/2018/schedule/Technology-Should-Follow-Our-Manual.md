description: >-
  Over time we've been taught to follow the preset instruction manuals of our machines and devices, but with the constant evolution of technology the tides are turning.\n\nIn this workshop we'll learn to brainstorm and doodle to come-up with creative solutions for how everyday technology can be redesigned to address our needs, be more playful, and ultimately understand our intent.\n\nYou'll be collaborating with others using techniques that could help you come imagine weirder and wilder ideas.
