  Massimo Vignelli learned early in his career that a designer should be able to design everything, coining the term ‘Design is One.’ This presentation will focus on the bridges that exist between graphic, industrial, web, and user experience design with a focus on producing artifacts and communication when developing and disseminating work across different platforms and media.
