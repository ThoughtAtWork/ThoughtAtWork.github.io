  NASA’s rovers on Mars brought us the first proof of water on our neighboring planet. Voyager, Juno and Cassini spacecraft have captured stunning images and with them, the hearts and imaginations of the world. Learn the soup to nuts of how missions like these become a reality, and how NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory is using design thinking to improve its mission design practices. You’ll hear firsthand stories of how user experience design fits into an 80 year old process, and how it’s changing the ways that NASA approaches unmanned exploration of the solar system and beyond.
