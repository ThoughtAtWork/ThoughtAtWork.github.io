  description: >-
    Over the past few decades, the definition of a designer has rapidly evolved alongside technology. From print, to web, to mobile, the roles of professional designers have shifted, as have the tools, skills, and challenges they face every day. As interfaces continue to expand beyond handheld devices, what will the role of designers be in 5 or 10 years from now? This presentation will explore design specializations \beyond screens\ that are already emerging and will become increasingly relevant in the future including voice, biometric design, and machine learning design. It will highlight the challenges these designers face, the tools and skills that are needed, and what you can do now to get up to speed with these developing fields.
