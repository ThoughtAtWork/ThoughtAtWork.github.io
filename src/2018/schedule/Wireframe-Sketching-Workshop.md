description: >-
  This workshop will teach students from all backgrounds and experience levels, how to take a step back from the screen and sketch digital experiences. Iâ€™ll teach students the process I go through from user flows, experience maps and wireframes. Students will be able to use the tools I use on a daily basis and help them grow their user experience thinking and skill set!
