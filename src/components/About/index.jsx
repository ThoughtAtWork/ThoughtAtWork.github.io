            This conference is entirely run by students. We contact speakers, we craft the schedule, we print the posters, and we produce the title sequence. We meet up year-round, we balance our coursework, we wrap our heads around the big picture, and we stress about the details. Our team changes every year and represents a broad range of disciplines and experiences, but weâ€™re tied together by need to inspire, grow, and teach our community.
