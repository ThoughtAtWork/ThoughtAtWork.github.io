      "description": "Design school is a great place to learn about how to design tangible things: logos, posters, digital products, app interfaces, videos, and service concepts. But what about designing the intangible? Grasping the intangible often requires embracing an attitude that enables you to navigate through the fog of messy systems and politics so that you can design clear and meaningful solutions. In this talk, I will share my experience applying design to social problems and unpack how I have used the methods I learned in design school to create processes that drive collaboration, creative problem-solving, and organizational learning within large institutions. We’ll look at things like how design-informed approaches can help individuals experiencing homelessness access services, improve the quality of care within the child welfare system, and rethink how we support people in the criminal justice system."

Recently, I learned that I create average work when I am comfortable and not being pushed or challenged. But once I create discomfort, I become challenged to do more than the average, and that’s when I create work that is truly creative. \n\nThis talk will cover what I do to continually be challenged, including work at Stink Studios that invoked discomfort, what it looks like to run an independent newsletter, and finding ways you can challenge yourself in your daily life."

However as the industry has matured and the tools have become more homogeneous, designers are growing restless, looking for what's next. Thankfully, there's a growing appetite for designers' skills in industries previously unable to benefit from their abilities. Tools like Cinder and Processing are paving the way for partnerships between designers and technologists that will fundamentally change not just the content of our screens but also physical environments like museums and retail."

As interfaces continue to expand beyond handheld devices, what will the role of designers be in 5 or 10 years from now? This presentation will explore design specializations \"beyond screens\" that are already emerging and will become increasingly relevant in the future including voice, biometric design, and machine learning design. It will highlight the challenges these designers face, the tools and skills that are needed, and what you can do now to get up to speed with these developing fields."

This helps us create a collaborative, customer-centric environment that brings together product design, user experience, engineering, and product management, that focuses on building the right product and building the product right."
